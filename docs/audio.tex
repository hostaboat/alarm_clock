\section{Introduction}

The left side of the front panel is devoted to \mAu{f} playback and control.
Its functionality is available at all times independent of any mode the device
may be in.\footnote{ One exception is during touch calibration - see
\hyperref[Touch Settings]{\mTS{ss}}.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item It can \sAuPl{f} and \sAuPa{f} the audio files stored on the removable
    \cMSD{f} attached to the circuit board.
  \item You can \sAuSt{f} it for extra power savings when running unplugged.
  \item It can \sAuSk{f} forward or backward tracks or rewind the current track.
\end{itemize}

\info{The \cDi{f} is \textit{not} capable of
displaying the track \textit{name} being played so track
\textit{numbers}\footnote{ The numbers represent the order on disk and not any
kind of album track order.} are displayed instead when applicable.}

There is an auto-stop feature that can be enabled via
\hyperref[Power Settings]{\mPS{f}}.  If in the \sAuPa{f} state for a
configurable amount of time, the \mAu{f} will automatically turn off
and go into the \sAuSt{f} state.

% Volume
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Volume} \label{Audio - Volume}

The \cVo{f} knob controls the volume level of the \mAu{f}\footnote{ The
\cVo{ss} is not connected to the \cBe{ss} so cannot control its volume.}
and has a \textit{white arrow} indicator on the sleeve.  Unlike the \cEs{f} and
\cBr{f} it does \textit{not} turn indefinitely and stops at the
\textit{minimum} and \textit{maximum} positions as indicated below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Turn \textit{clockwise} to \textit{increase} the volume.
  \item Turn \textit{counter-clockwise} to \textit{decrease} the volume.
\end{itemize}

\section{Play | Pause | Stop} \label{Audio - Play|Pause|Stop}

The \thinspace\sPl\enspace push-button can \sAuPl{f}, \sAuPa{f} or \sAuSt{f}
the \mAu{f}.

\par\medskip

The \mAu{f} starts in the \sAuSt{f} state when the device is initially switched
\sOn{f} via the \cPo{f}.  To start playback, \aPR{f}.

\ase{1}{{c c c c}}{%
\sAuSt{sym} & \sPlay & \eStart{sym}{PLAYBACK} & \sAuPl{sym} \\}

To \sAuPa{f}, \aPR{f} when in the \sAuPl{f} state.

\ase{1}{{c c c c}}{%
\sAuPl{sym} & \sPause & \ePa{sym}{PLAYBACK} & \sAuPa{sym} \\}

To resume playback, \aPR{f} when in the \sAuPa{f} state.

\ase{1}{{c c c c}}{%
\sAuPa{sym} & \sPlay & \eResume{sym}{PLAYBACK} & \sAuPl{sym} \\}

To \sAuSt{f} the \mAu{f} when in \sAuPl{f} or \sAuPa{f} states, \aPH{f} for
\mono{2} seconds and \aRe{f} when the \cDi{f} shows

  & \multirow{2}{*}{\sAuSt{sym}} \\ \dcrule{1}{1}
\sAuPa{sym} & & & \\}

Besides the power savings that \sAuSt{f} provides over \sAuPa{f},
there is another difference between \sAuPa{f} and \sAuSt{f}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item When resuming from \sAuPa{f}, the the track will resume playing from
    the same place as when it was paused.
  \item When resuming from \sAuSt{f}, the track will start playing from the
    beginning.
\end{itemize}

\section{Next} \label{Audio - Next}

The \thinspace\sNe\enspace push-button is used to \aSkip{f} \textit{forward}
one or more tracks.  

\begin{itemize}
  \item \aPR{f} to \aSkip{f} to the \textit{next} track.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The next track number will \textit{not} be shown on the \cDi{f}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \aPH{f} to \aSkip{f} \textit{forward} one or more tracks.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The longer the push-button is held, the faster tracks will progress.
      \item The track numbers \textit{will} be shown on the \cDi{f}, for
        example:
        \figD{!!22}{Track \#22}
      \item \aRe{f} when you get to the track you want.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Previous} \label{Audio - Previous}

The \thinspace\sPr\enspace push-button is used to \aSkip{f} \textit{backward}
one or more tracks or \dRe{f} the current track.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \aPR{f}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \dRe{f} the current track if more than $\frac{1}{4}$ of the track
        has played.
      \item Otherwise, \aSkip{f} to the \textit{previous} track.
      \item The track number will \textit{not} be shown on the \cDi{f}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \aPH{f} to \aSkip{f} \textit{backward} one or more tracks.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The longer the push-button is held, the faster tracks will progress.
      \item The track numbers \textit{will} be shown on the \cDi{f}, for example:
        \figD{!!!8}{Track \#8}
      \item \aRe{f} when you get to the track you want.

% Track Selection
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Track Selection} \label{Audio - Track Selection}

In addition to using the \cNe{f} and \cPr{f} controls to \sAuSk{f} forward and
backward in order to select a track for playback, there also exists the
capability to select a track more quickly and directly when in
\hyperref[Clock]{\mCl{f}} mode.  The \cEs{f} can be used alone or in
combination with \aTo{f} to do so.  Refer to \hyperref[Show Track]{Show Track}
and \hyperref[Set Track]{Set Track} in that section for more information.
