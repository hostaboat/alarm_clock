# Alarm Clock

## An alarm clock, timer and music player using a Teensy 3.2 and various Adafruit breakout boards.

Many thanks to: 
* **Paul Stoffregen** for the [Teensy 3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy) development board, supporting code base (from which I used as a reference along with the Freescale documentation) and [command line loader](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/teensy_loader_cli) program which allowed me to develop and test sans the Arduino IDE.
* **Daniel Garcia** for the [FastLED](http://fastled.io) library from which I borrowed.
* [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com) for the various breakout boards used.
* [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com) for providing their community PCB service.
* [Othermachine](https://othermachine.co) for the Othermill used to create the enclosure.
