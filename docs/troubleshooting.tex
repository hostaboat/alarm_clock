\chapter{Errors} \label{Error Codes}

Listed below are all of the possible errors that the device can recognize.  In
the event that you see one show up on the \cDi{f}, try the following.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \aTu{f} or \aPr{f} the \cEs{f} or \aTu{f} the \cRs{f} or fiddle with
    some other control on the \cFr{f} or \aTo{f} the \cTo{f} if the \cTS{f} is
    enabled.
\end{itemize}

If the error on the \cDi{f} doesn't go away or the problem continues to persist:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Switch the device \sOff{f} then back \sOn{f} using the \cPo{f}.
\end{itemize}

Again, if the error doesn't go away or the problem continues to persist, refer
to the following sections.

\info{If you are unable to resolve the problem or the device is unusable because
of the problem, please send the device back for repair.  Almost every part is
replaceable.}

\section{Hardware}

This class of error indicates a problem with the hardware.  There are a
few possibilities as to the cause:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The named piece of hardware has failed.
  \item The microcontroller has failed.
  \item The \textit{connection} between the named piece of hardware and
    microcontroller has been severed.  This could be a due to a couple
    or reasons:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A cable that connects the named piece of hardware to the
        circuit board is disconnected or severed, \textit{or}
      \item A solder connection or trace on the circuit board has gone bad.
    \end{itemize}
  \item The named piece of hardware is actually working which likely points to a
    bug in the software.
\end{enumerate}

It is also possible that a piece of hardware could be malfunctioning without
any error showing up on the \cDi{f}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Controls
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Controls}

If there is a problem with one of the controls, first check to see if the
cable connecting the control to the circuit board is disconnected or severed.
Refer to \hyperref[Disassembly]{Disassembly} for instructions on removing the
\cTo{f}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Controls - Selector Dial
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Selector Dial}

\sD{!!!1} \sD{C.SEL.}

\par\bigskip

The side of the cable that is connected to the \cRs{f} is soldered.  There
are \num{4} connections to the \cRs{f}.  If any one of these is disconnected
then the problem is likely one of connection and \textit{not} due to the
\cRs{f} itself being broken.

\par\medskip

The side of the cable that is connected to the circuit board is a very secure
connection, however, it is possible that a solder joint that connects the
female connector to the circuit board has failed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Screens - Display
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Display}

\sD{!!!8} \sD{dISP.}

\par\bigskip

The \cDi{f} is actually working, at least in part, if you see this error.
It indicates a problem with the \textbf{I$^2$C} communication bus between the
\cDi{f} and the microcontroller.

\par\medskip

The cable connection to both the \cDi{f} and circuit board is are very
secure connections, however, it is possible that a solder joint that connects
the female connector to one or both has failed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Screens - Lighting
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Lighting}

\sD{!!!9} \sD{LEdS}

\par\bigskip

There are \num{2} rows of \num{8} LEDs in each row that make up the \cLi{f}.
Each row or strip is soldered to a small circuit board.  These connections
may be the problem for the failure.

\par\medskip

The cable connection to both the \cLi{f} and circuit board is are very
secure connections, however, it is possible that a solder joint that connects
the female connector to one or both has failed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Touch Sensor
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Touch Sensor}

\sD{!!10} \sD{tUCH}

\par\bigskip

There is a wire connecting the \cTS{f} to the microcontroller.  The terminal
connecting to the \cTS{f} is a ring terminal held in place by a screw.  Make
sure this is tight.

\par\medskip

Otherwise, the cable may be severed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Filesystem or Micro SD Card
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Filesystem or Micro SD Card}

\sD{!!11} \sD{FILE}

\par\bigskip

This could mean that either:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The filesystem on the \cMSD{f} is not formatted as \mono{FAT32} with
    \num{512} bytes / sector, \textit{or}
  \item The filesystem is corrupted and/or the \cMSD{f} is bad.
\end{enumerate}

If you have just replaced the \cMSD{f}, it may mean that it was formatted
incorrectly.  If you haven't replaced the \cMSD{f}, then it will likely need
replacing.  Refer to \hyperref[Removing SD Card]{Removing the Micro SD Card}
for instructions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Audio Decoder or Amplifier
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Audio Decoder or Amplifier}

\sD{!!12} \sD{Aud.!}

issues.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Audio - Disabled
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Audio Disabled}

\sD{!!13} \sD{PLAY}

\par\bigskip

This error indicates that the \mAu{f} has been \textit{disabled} due to one of
the following:

\begin{table}[H]
\ers{0.1}
\centering
\begin{tabu}{c}
  \symD{!!11} \symD{FILE} \\
  \symD{!!12} \symD{Aud.!} \\
  \symD{!!14} \symD{P.FIL.} \\
  \symD{!!15} \symD{P.OPE.} \\
  \symD{!!16} \symD{P.Aud.} \\
\end{tabu}
\end{table}

You will see one of the above errors \textit{first}, then this error indicating
that the \mAu{f} has been disabled and is unusable.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Audio - Files
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Audio Files}

\par\bigskip

\begin{table}[H]
\ers{3.0}
\begin{tabu}{X[1,c,m] X[4,l,m]}
  \mrule
  \sD{!!14} \sD{P.FIL.}
    & There is a problem obtaining the audio files from the \cMSD{f}. \\ \drule{2}
  \sD{!!15} \sD{P.OPE.}
    & There is a problem opening an audio file that is on the the \cMSD{f}. \\ \drule{2}
  \sD{!!16} \sD{P.Aud.}
    & There is a problem communicating with the audio decoder or a problem
      reading an audio file that is on the the \cMSD{f}. \\
  \mrule
\end{tabu}
\end{table}

These are likely due to one of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The \cMSD{f} is not formatted correctly or is failing.
  \item There is a problem with the audio decoder.
\end{enumerate}

If you have just replaced the \cMSD{f}, it may mean that it was formatted
incorrectly.  If you haven't replaced the \cMSD{f}, then try replacing it.
Refer to \hyperref[Removing SD Card]{Removing the Micro SD Card} for
instructions.

\par\medskip

If the above doesn't solve the problem, then it likely means that the audio
decoder has failed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Timer
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Timer}

\sD{!!17} \sD{T.PIt.}

\par\bigskip

This error indicates that a timer could not be acquired.  It should
never happen and indicates a bug in the software.
