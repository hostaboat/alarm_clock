\chapter{Introduction}

The enclosure is made of \wood{} wood with a dewaxed shellac finish. The front
panel is made of \front{}.

\par\bigskip

\danger{Do not get alcohol anywhere near this.  The wood finish is shellac
whose solvent is alcohol.  Alcohol will ruin the finish, i.e. dissolve it like
turpentine will with oil based paint.  So don't rest your beer bottle, glass of
wine or shot of tequila on top.  And to be safe, don't clean it with any kind of
chemical cleaning solution.  A dry or slightly damp rag, preferably microfiber,
should be sufficient to get fingerprints, dust and other crud off of the wood
finish and \front{} front.}

\par\bigskip

\danger{Before trying to disassemble the enclosure to either replace the
\hyperref[Coin Cell Battery]{\cCC{f}} or remove the
\hyperref[Micro SD Card]{\cMSD{f}} card, please read the
\hyperref[Disassembly]{Disassembly} section.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Front} \label{Front}

The \cFr{f} is made of \front{} with cast acrylic windows for the
\hyperref[Display]{\cDi{f}} and \hyperref[Lighting]{\cLi{f}}. It contains all of
the controls and screens necessary for interacting with the device except for
the \hyperref[Touch Sensor]{\cTS{f}} which is located underneath the
\hyperref[Top]{\cTo{f}} of the enclosure.

% Front - Power - Power Switch
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Power Switch} \label{Power Switch}

The \cPo{f} is a latching switch used to turn the device \sON{f} and \sOFF{f}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item To turn the device \sON{f}, press inward until you hear a mechanical
    click and feel it lock in place.
  \item To turn the device \sOFF{f}, press inward until you hear a mechanical
    click and feel it release.
\end{itemize}

You can visually tell whether the switch is \sON{f} or \sOFF{f} by whether or
not it is lit.\footnote{ The color of the light may vary.}

\begin{table}[H]
\ers{1}
\centering
\begin{tabu} to 7cm { X[1,c,m] X[1,c,m] }
  \sON{n} & \sOFF{n} \\
  \includegraphics{images/onoff_on.png} & \includegraphics{images/onoff_off.png} \\
\end{tabu}
\caption{Power Switch - ON | OFF Indication}
\end{table}

It will also be flush with the bevel when \sOFF{f} and sunken in when \sON{f}.

\par\medskip

A few items of note:

\begin{itemize}
  \item When the device is plugged in there is no need to switch the device
    \sOFF{f}.
  \item To reduce power consumption when running unplugged, instead of switching
    the device \sOFF{f}, you can:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Use the \hyperref[Brightness Knob]{\cBr{f}} to blank both the
        \hyperref[Display]{\cDi{f}} and \hyperref[Lighting]{\cLi{f}}.
      \item Use \hyperref[Play|Pause|Stop]{\cPl{f}} to \sAuSt{f} the
        \hyperref[Audio]{\mAu{f}}.
      \item Set \mPSNa{f}, \mPSSt{f} and/or \mPSSl{f} timers or forcibly put the
        device to sleep using \mPSTo{f} - see \hyperref[Power Settings]{\mPS{f}}
        for configuration and usage.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Front - Power - Low Battery Indicator
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Low Battery Indicator} \label{Low Battery Indicator}

The \cLB{f} is a red LED and is used to indicate that the device needs to be
recharged.  When the light turns on, the battery charge is getting low.

\begin{table}[H]
\ers{1}
\centering
\begin{tabu} to 6cm { X[1,c,m] X[1,c,m] }
  OK & LOW \\
  \includegraphics{images/lowbat_off.png}
    & \includegraphics{images/lowbat_on.png} \\
\end{tabu}
\caption{Low Battery Indicator}
\end{table}

Note that when music is playing, the light might flicker on and off. This is
because the electric current varies a great deal when playing audio and a high
volume setting and/or certain sounds (usually low end sounds) can cause the
voltage in the circuit to temporarily drop triggering the \cLB{f}.  Turning
the volume down may get rid of the flicker.  Either way, the battery should
be recharged.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Front - Screens
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Screens}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Front - Screens - Display
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Display} \label{Display}

The \cDi{f} is the primary means of conveying information.  It is an LED
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment\_display}{Seven-Segment Display}
and can display the full range of numerical digits as well as the majority of
letters.\footnote{ See \hyperref[Display Digits]{Number \& Letter Display Representations}
in the Appendix for a complete list.}  It can also display a decimal point after
each digit and a colon in the middle.

\par\medskip

The brightness of the \cDi{f} is controlled by the
\hyperref[Brightness Knob]{\cBr{f}}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Front - Screens - Lighting
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Lighting} \label{Lighting}

The \cLi{f} is made up of \num{16} RGB LEDs - 2 rows with \num{8} in each row.
A translucent white plastic called Delrin is used to diffuse the light.  Its
primary use is as a night light or timer status indicator.
See \hyperref[Clock]{\mCl{f}} and \hyperref[Timer]{\mTi{f}} respectively for
more information on its use and \hyperref[Set Night Light]{\mSN{f}} for
instructions on setting the \num{3} configurable night light colors.

\par\medskip

The brightness of the \cLi{f} window is controlled by the
\hyperref[Brightness Knob]{\cBr{f}}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Front - Screens - Brightness Knob
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Brightness Knob} \label{Brightness Knob}

The \cBr{f} is an optical rotary encoder and is used to control the brightness
of both the \hyperref[Display]{\cDi{f}} and \hyperref[Lighting]{\cLi{f}}. It
does not have start or stop positions and will turn indefinitely in either
direction.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Turn \textit{clockwise} to \textit{increase} the brightness.
  \item Turn \textit{counter-clockwise} to \textit{decrease} the
    brightness.\footnote{ The \cDi{ss} does not dim seamlessly and you will
    likely notice that it jumps or drops in brightness.  This is normal
    behavior as the hardware only supports \num{16} brightness levels.}
\end{itemize}

Continually turning in one direction or the other will eventually either:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Reach a \textit{maximum} brightness, or
  \item Blank both the \cDi{f} and \cLi{f}.
\end{enumerate}

\info{When running on battery power and not using the \cDi{f} or \cLi{f} - for
example, if just listening to music - turn the \cBr{f} \textit{counter-clockwise}
until they go blank to prolong battery charge.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Front - UI Controls
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{UI Controls}

The \cRs{f} and \cEs{f} are the primary controls used to interact with the
device and make use of its functionality.

\chapter{Powering \& Recharging} \label{Powering and Recharging}

The device can be both powered and charged using either the supplied
\hyperref[Power Adapter]{\cPA{f}} or a \textit{USB 2.0 Standard Type-A Male to
Micro Type-B Male} cable.

\par\medskip

\cUSB{f} is asymmetric and can only be plugged in one way.

\begin{figure}[H]

% Powering & Recharging - Recharging
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Recharging} \label{Recharging}

The \hyperref[Low Battery Indicator]{\cLB{f}} will light up when the device
needs to be recharged.  Unfortunately there is no way to indicate that the
battery has finished charging. Using the supplied
\hyperref[Power Adapter]{\cPA{f}}, it should take about \num{8} hours to charge
if the \cLB{f} is signaling - plug it in before going to bed and it should be
charged by the time you wake up.  When using a \textit{USB 2.0 Standard Type-A
Male to Micro Type-B Male} cable, charging may take longer since USB ports on a
computer generally do not supply as much current as the \cPA{f} will.
